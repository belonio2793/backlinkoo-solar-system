  <h2>Stage Playbooks</h2>
  <h3>Early Stage</h3>
  <p>Ship two cornerstone explainers and one linkable asset (calculator or study). Pursue 10–15 outreach targets weekly. Keep anchors brand‑forward. Measure indexation and entity coverage.</p>
  <h3>Growth Stage</h3>
  <p>Expand linkable assets to a quarterly cadence and introduce Digital PR. Maintain a refresh loop for winners. Approve vendor‑led placements for commercial gaps with partial‑match anchors.</p>
  <h3>Enterprise Stage</h3>
  <p>Build an in‑house editorial function with research design. Run PR, outreach, and vendor capacity in parallel. Codify governance: anchors, publisher QA, SOPs, and remediation SLAs.</p>
