  <h2>Methodology: From Brief to Backlink</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Research Synthesis:</strong> Pull public data, run small surveys, and triangulate findings. Document assumptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Angle Selection:</strong> Identify the counterintuitive or useful core. Draft three headlines that solve a newsroom problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Asset Design:</strong> Create charts, maps, and interactives that can be embedded. Include alt text and data notes.</li>
    <li><strong>Editorial Draft:</strong> Write to educate first. Use subheadings that match search intent and entity coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>Outreach & PR:</strong> Segment journalists/bloggers by beat. Send context-aware pitches with a paragraph editors can paste.</li>
    <li><strong>QA & Publication:</strong> Verify accuracy, citations, and internal links. Publish and request feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Track indexation, referring domains by page, and assisted conversions. Iterate.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Analytics and Attribution</h2>
  <p>Connect backlinks to business outcomes. Attribute assisted conversions by tracking the landing pages that receive editorial links and their down-funnel paths.

  <h2>Editorial Calendars and Refresh Cadence</h2>
  <p>An editorial calendar prevents random acts of content. Define monthly slots for studies, explainers, and playbooks. Every quarter, refresh top performers—update data, expand sections, and improve visuals. This refresh loop increases the odds of continual citation and aligns with Siege Media’s emphasis on quality.</p>
