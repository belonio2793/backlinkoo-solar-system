  <h2>Why a Vendor-Agnostic Framework Matters</h2>
  <p>Service threads evolve, domains change hands, and ecosystems shift. A durable buying process beats chasing one-off recommendations. This section distills practices that remain useful regardless of which seller you choose.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decide what success looks like—movement for cluster terms, qualified traffic, assisted conversions.</li>
    <li>Favor editorial value and topic fit; treat DR/DA as secondary signals.</li>
    <li>Write clear briefs so anchors land naturally and articles help readers.</li>
    <li>Measure indexation and page visibility at 30/90 days; annotate outcomes.</li>
    <li>Keep a replacement playbook—what qualifies, how long it takes, and who owns follow‑ups.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Profiles: Additional Considerations</h2>
  <p>Use the following questions to guide conversations with each vendor: which topics fit best, what turnaround to expect, and how they verify indexation. Save learnings in a shared document so you can repeat what works.</p>

  <h2>Operational Cadence</h2>
  <p>Weekly: approve briefs, review proofs, log live links, check early indexation signals. Monthly: rebalance anchors, expand on high‑performing topics, refresh internal links to carry authority into converting pages. Quarterly: refactor clusters, retire underperformers, and raise the editorial bar.</p>
