  <h2>Case Library: Patterns That Generalize</h2>
  <div class="sm-grid">
    <div class="sm-card"><h3>Marketplace</h3><p>Inventory depth created confusion and crawl waste. Consolidated guides, canonicalized variants, and shipped a pricing index that drew citations. Paired with partial‑match anchors from relevant publications, category pages rose without aggressive exact‑match.</p></div>
    <div class="sm-card"><h3>Fintech</h3><p>Regulatory topics require precision. Built a terminology primer and calculators for fees/APY comparisons; journalists cited both in coverage. Equity flowed to product pages through careful internal linking.</p></div>
    <div class="sm-card"><h3>Healthcare</h3><p>Trust is paramount. Published clinician‑reviewed explainers with structured data and conservative anchors. Links clustered around patient education hubs that support service pages.</p></div>
