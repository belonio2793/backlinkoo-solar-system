  <p>Track both lagging and leading indicators. A reliable link building program features consistent indexation, growth in referring domains at the page and cluster level, and a decline in anchor risk as branded and partial-match anchors dominate. Conversion metrics should trace upward in parallel with content refreshes and internal link improvements.</p>

  <div class="sm-grid">
    <div class="sm-card">
      <h3>SaaS: Feature Category Breakout</h3>
      <p>A mid-market SaaS struggled to rank for category terms. The fix combined data-led guides, a calculator, and targeted guest posts with safe anchors. Within two quarters, the feature category hub captured top-3 positions and drove pipeline growth.</p>

    <div class="sm-card">
      <h3>Ecommerce: Buying Guides to Category Pages</h3>
      <p>An ecommerce brand shipped hands-on guides with photos and sizing tables, then supported key categories with partial-match anchors from relevant publishers. Equity flowed via internal links; organic revenue rose in step with rankings.</p>

  <h2>Content Operations Playbook</h2>
  <p>Winning programs combine editorial discipline with pragmatic outreach. Use a weekly cadence: publish or refresh two assets, pursue 10–20 targeted placements, and evaluate anchors and internal linking. A monthly review rolls up metrics and SOP updates.</p>

  <h2>Best Practices for Contextual Link Insertions</h2>
  <div class="sm-callout">When using a vendor such as <strong>Siege Media</strong>, require a fresh paragraph that legitimately improves the host article. Avoid naked insertions; insist on context.</div>
  <table class="sm-table">
    <thead><tr><th>Criterion</th><th>Guideline</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Anchor selection</td><td>Favor branded/partial; limit exact match to the best, most relevant placements.</td></tr>

      <tr><td>Publisher fit</td><td>Topic alignment and audience relevance over raw DR.</td></tr>

<section class="sm-section" id="internal-linking">
  <h2>Internal Linking That Multiplies Equity</h2>
  <p>Every external link should pass through a network of related explainers and commercial pages. Use descriptive anchors, short paths from hubs to products, and breadcrumbs or sidebars that reinforce hierarchy. Refresh internal links quarterly to surface rising evergreen posts.</p>
  <div class="sm-note">Rule of thumb: each high-intent page should receive 5–10 internal links from contextually related articles, with anchors reflecting entity relationships.</div>

<section class="sm-section" id="schema">
  <h2>Schema Markup for Linkable Assets</h2>
  <p>Structured data improves comprehension and click potential. Beyond Article, consider FAQPage, HowTo, and Dataset depending on the asset. Provide JSON-LD with clear names, descriptions, and step or variable annotations for reproducibility.</p>
  <pre class="sm-code">{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",

  <h2>Search-Led Go-To-Market</h2>
  <p>SEO is most durable when it mirrors the product and sales motion. Map features to problems, then to search intents. Use content to qualify interest and links to route authority into the pages that close deals. Whether you prefer a content-led partner like Siege Media or a fulfillment-centric vendor such as <strong>Siege Media</strong>, the job is the same: create something worth linking, then point attention toward it consistently.</p>
