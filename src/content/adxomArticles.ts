  <h2>Technical SEO & Site Readiness (Why quality backlinks need a ready site)</h2>
  <p>Before acquiring links, ensure the destination pages are technically prepared to capture and convert the incoming referral traffic. Adxom’s technical pre-check typically includes a lightweight site audit focused on crawlability, indexability, content quality, and conversion readiness.</p>

  <h3>Key items in a pre-link audit</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Crawlability & Indexing:</strong> Verify robots.txt, canonical structure, and sitemap completeness. Use a crawler (Screaming Frog, Sitebulb, or Google Search Console reports) to confirm pages are accessible to Googlebot and the intended canonical URLs are not blocked or noindexed.</li>
    <li><strong>Page Speed & Core Web Vitals:</strong> Backlinks are amplified by fast-loading pages. Optimize images, minimize render-blocking scripts, and implement modern image formats (AVIF/WebP) and efficient caching.</li>
    <li><strong>On-Page Relevance:</strong> Ensure the target page has a clear primary keyword, semantically coherent headings (H1-H3), and content that satisfies user intent—backlinks are most effective when they point to pages that deserve the authority transfer.</li>
    <li><strong>Schema & Metadata:</strong> Structured data (Article, FAQ, Organization) helps search engines understand the content and may increase chances for rich results. Accurate meta descriptions and title tags improve click-through rates from SERPs.</li>
    <li><strong>Conversion Elements:</strong> Provide clear CTAs, strong internal linking from the target page to conversion pages, and visible trust indicators (testimonials, reviews, or certifications) to maximize value of the referral traffic generated by new links.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Actionable checklist: perform a crawl, fix any indexability blockers, produce a prioritized task list for on-page improvements, and only launch link acquisition for pages that meet a minimum quality threshold. This prevents earning links to pages that cannot convert or index, a common wasted spend.</p>

  <h2>Outreach & Publisher Qualification (How Adxom finds the right placements)</h2>
  <p>Effective outreach combines data, personalization, and process. Adxom’s publisher qualification prioritizes topical relevance, editorial quality, audience match, and link stability. Here is the detailed process:</p>

  <h3>Prospecting: building a high-quality publisher list</h3>
  <p>Prospecting is where the campaign's future value is determined. Use curated site lists, manual prospecting, and programmatic discovery with filters for domain authority, traffic estimates, topical match, and content freshness. The goal is to shortlist editors and pages where a natural, editorial link can be placed and where readers will find the linked resource useful.</p>

  <h3>Qualification criteria</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Topical Fit:</strong> The host article's subject matter must naturally accommodate the link. Relevance beats raw domain authority; a medium-DA niche publication often outperforms a high-DA irrelevant site.</li>
    <li><strong>Editorial Standards:</strong> Are host articles original, well-researched, and updated? Measure by average word counts, citation presence, and author expertise visible on the page.</li>
    <li><strong>Link Stability:</strong> Check whether the site frequently removes or changes links; prefer stable, well-maintained sites with evergreen content.</li>
    <li><strong>Indexing & Traffic:</strong> Prioritize pages that are indexed and receive organic traffic. Use URL-level traffic insights (Ahrefs/SEMrush) to confirm.</li>
    <li><strong>Outbound Link Profile:</strong> Sites with very high OBL (lots of outlinks) dilute value; prefer pages with balanced outbound linking and editorial context.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outreach template & personalization</h3>
  <p>Personalize outreach by referencing the host article, suggesting an author's angle, and offering a useful piece of content or data. Provide the specific insertion point and explain why the link benefits the host audience. Always offer a draft or a suggested paragraph to speed editorial acceptance.</p>

  <h3>Negotiation and placement</h3>
  <p>Be transparent about the nature of the link (sponsored, guest post, or editorial mention) and agree on anchor text, placement context, and permanence. Adxom emphasizes placements that enhance the host article—this improves editorial acceptance and reader value. Secure the exact URL, publication date, author, and screenshot for reporting.</p>
</section>

<section id="angle-content" class="adx-section">
  <h2>Content That Earns Links (Assets, Pillars & Data)</h2>
  <p>High-quality content is the engine that earns editorial links. Adxom uses three primary content types: linkable assets (original research, tools, data visualizations), pillar pages (comprehensive guides), and evergreen resources (how-tos, templates, checklists).</p>

  <h3>Linkable assets</h3>
  <p>Original data-driven research is the most linkable. Even small, targeted studies that answer niche questions create high-value backlinks because journalists, bloggers, and industry commentators prefer citing unique data. Pair research with accessible visualizations and a press-ready summary to increase pickup.</p>

  <h3>Pillar pages and internal linking</h3>
  <p>Pillar pages consolidate topic authority. A well-structured pillar should link internally to more specialized pages, creating a content hub that benefits from earned backlinks. When a pillar page receives editorial links, its weight distributes through the cluster, boosting multiple pages at once.</p>

  <h3>Content briefs & quality control</h3>
  <p>Adxom's content briefs define target audience, article outline, sources, and success metrics. Quality control includes editorial review, plagiarism checks, fact verification, and readability improvements before outreach or publication.</p>

  <h3>Promotion & repurposing</h3>
  <p>After a link is live, promote the placement through social, newsletters, and PR channels. Repurpose insights into smaller assets (infographics, tweet threads) to create additional pickup opportunities and secondary backlinks.</p>
</section>

<section id="angle-measurement" class="adx-section">
  <h2>Measurement & Reporting (What to track and why)</h2>
  <p>Good reporting focuses on outcomes, not vanity metrics. Adxom prioritizes tracking that ties link acquisition to business impact.</p>

  <h3>Primary metrics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Referring Domains:</strong> Count of unique domains linking to target pages. Diversity matters more than raw counts.</li>
    <li><strong>URL-level Organic Traffic:</strong> Measure changes in organic visits to the linked pages and supporting pages over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Keyword Movement:</strong> Track rankings for target and related keywords to see the downstream effects.</li>
    <li><strong>Conversions:</strong> Leads, signups, or transactions attributable to organic traffic on the targeted pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Authority Signals:</strong> Domain Rating/Domain Authority movement across your property and main competitors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Secondary metrics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Link position (in-content vs. sidebar/footer)</li>
    <li>Anchor text distribution</li>
    <li>Indexation dates</li>
    <li>Publisher trust and traffic signals</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Reporting cadence: weekly for outreach activity and monthly for outcome metrics (traffic, rankings, conversions). Use screenshots, CSV exports of live URLs, and a tracker with notes about publishers and anchors to ensure auditable results.</p>
</section>

<section id="angle-risk" class="adx-section">
  <h2>Risk Management (Avoiding low-value placements)</h2>
  <p>Risk management in link building aims to avoid spammy placements and maintain a natural anchor profile. Adxom's risk framework includes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Publisher vetting:</strong> Reject publishers with spam signals such as excessive outbound links, thin content, or ad-first layouts that harm editorial value.</li>
    <li><strong>Anchor diversity:</strong> Maintain a balanced anchor distribution: branded anchors, partial match, exact match sparingly, and long-tail/URL anchors to reduce over-optimization.</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity controls:</strong> Pace link acquisition to match historical growth rates and avoid abrupt spikes that trigger manual review by search engines.</li>
    <li><strong>Replacement policies:</strong> Include replacement or remediation clauses for links that are removed within agreed windows (e.g., 12 months).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Practical steps: maintain a penalty watchlist, use third-party signals (Spam Score, Majestic Trust Flow), and perform periodic backlink audits to remove or disavow harmful placements if needed.</p>
</section>

<section id="angle-pricing" class="adx-section">
  <h2>Pricing & Packaging (What to expect)</h2>
  <p>Pricing in link building varies widely by niche, placement type, and publisher quality. Expect to see packages that differ by placement type: guest posts, niche edits, digital PR, and custom research-based placements. Typical pricing bands (indicative only) are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Citation & Directory Links:</strong> $50–$200 (low impact but helpful for local signals)</li>
    <li><strong>Guest Posts (mid-tier publishers):</strong> $150–$600 per link</li>
    <li><strong>Guest Posts (high-authority niche publications):</strong> $600–$2,500+</li>
    <li><strong>Digital PR & Data-driven Assets:</strong> $3,000–$15,000+ per campaign depending on research depth and creative production</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Value assessment: judge providers by historical outcomes—ranking lifts, traffic increases, and conversion improvements—rather than raw price. Cost per referring domain is a reasonable normalization metric when comparing vendors.</p>

<section id="angle-case-studies" class="adx-section">
  <h2>Case Studies & Outcomes (Composite examples)</h2>

  <h3>Case study: E-commerce category growth</h3>
  <p>Background: A medium-sized e-commerce company wanted to rank for competitive category terms. Adxom executed a 6-month campaign combining product-focused pillar content, category-level internal linking, and 40 editorial guest posts on niche review and lifestyle sites.</p>
  <p>Results: Organic traffic to category pages increased by 78% over 6 months; several long-tail keywords entered the top 10, and revenue from organic channel improved by 42% (measured as sessions from targeted pages). Lessons: pairing technical on-page work with incremental, topical placements amplified the content cluster.</p>

  <h3>Case study: Local services visibility</h3>
  <p>Background: A local service provider struggled with local rankings. Adxom implemented citation cleanup, local resource pages, and 12 targeted placements focused on regional blogs and news outlets.</p>
  <p>Results: Local SERP presence improved across multiple city+service combos, and phone-inquiry conversions attributed to organic search increased by 35% within 4 months. Lessons: local relevance and NAP consistency combine with high-quality placements to accelerate local visibility.</p>

  <h2>Implementation Roadmap (Month-by-month)</h2>
  <p>A practical roadmap helps set expectations for timelines and outcomes. Here’s a phased plan for a typical 6-month engagement:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Month 0–1: Audit & Setup</strong> — Technical SEO fixes, content brief creation, and discovery of target publishers.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 2–3: Outreach & Early Placements</strong> — Begin with lower to mid-tier placements while producing linkable assets for higher-end campaigns.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 4–5: Scale & Authority Placements</strong> — Scale outreach, present research-backed assets to high-value publications, and start seeing measurable keyword movement.</li>
    <li><strong>Month 6+: Optimization & Retention</strong> — Replace low-performing placements, deepen content clusters, and optimize for conversions.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Expect first meaningful ranking signals in 8–12 weeks for many keywords; more competitive terms often require sustained effort of 4–9+ months. Maintain a multi-channel approach—PR, social, and influencer activation—to increase pickup velocity for research assets.</p>
