  <h2>Deep dive — Narrative, signals, and social proof</h2>
  <p>This section expands on the cultural and tactical signals that make content authoritative and link-worthy. We'll unpack narrative structures, the signals that editors and creators look for, and concrete ways to turn everyday work into linkable assets.</p>

  <h3>Narrative arcs that attract attention</h3>
  <p>Editors and link builders look for stories. Data alone is useful; stories with context are memorable. Use a simple arc: problem → experiment → outcome → lessons learned. Each published experiment should include an explicit metric (sign-ups, conversion uplift, time saved) and a small visual asset (graph, before/after screenshot) to make it easier to reference and link back.</p>

  <h3>Signals that increase link likelihood</h3>
  <p>High-probability link signals include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Original data or a survey with a clear sample and methodology.</li>
    <li>Reusable assets such as templates, one-page cheatsheets, or embeddable widgets.</li>
    <li>Case studies with measurable outcomes (percent improvements, revenue numbers, user growth).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to package content for editors</h3>
  <p>When you pitch an editor or webmaster, don't make them copy — provide plug-and-play content. For a roundup or resource page, include a 2–3 sentence blurb, an image (900–1200px wide RGB sRGB), and a canonical citation with link and suggested anchor text. Provide a short attribution line they can paste under images.</p>

  <h3>Practical exercise: create a 1-page asset</h3>
  <p>Create a one-page asset that highlights: headline, 3 bullets describing the asset, 1 chart, 1 downloadable template, and 1 suggested quote for the editor. Host it behind a shareable URL (e.g., /assets/sv-girl-pack) so editors can link to it directly.</p>

<section id="long-form-case-study-1">
  <h2>Case study (expanded): Growing a design portfolio into paid workshops</h2>
  <p>This expanded case study documents a real-world tactic for converting attention into revenue. It contains an eight-month timeline, content cadence, promotional channels, conversion metrics, and a reproducible checklist.</p>

  <h3>Context</h3>
  <p>Designer started with a simple Twitter thread and a screenshot of a 'before/after' redesign. The first 12 posts were experimental — low expectation, high honesty. The content included short videos (30–90 seconds) showing iterations and the thought process.</p>

  <h3>Timeline & actions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Months 1–2: publish 1 thread and 1 2-minute video per week. Each post included a link to a case-study blog entry with a lead capture for a downloadable template.</li>
    <li>Months 3–4: launched first free workshop for early subscribers; collected feedback; repackaged content into a paid micro-course.</li>
    <li>Months 5–8: scaled via partnerships — hosted joint webinars, guest posts, and newsletter swaps. Focused outreach on product/design blogs and newsletters. Leveraged measured conversion rates to craft an outreach pitch showing 'X leads per 1,000 impressions'.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p>After eight months the designer: filled 3 paid cohorts, generated recurring revenue of $6k/month, and secured 12 editorial mentions including 3 resource pages which linked to the guide.</p>

  <h3>Replicable checklist</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ship one reproducible item weekly (video, thread, or mini-tutorial).</li>
    <li>Collect emails via a single downloadable asset.</li>
    <li>Run two outreach campaigns per quarter to newsletters and roundups.</li>
    <li>A/B test CTAs for workshop signups (e.g., 'join waitlist' vs 'book free call').</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="long-form-case-study-2">
  <h2>Case study (expanded): From open-source tool to paid layer</h2>
  <p>Engineer's path: built a small CLI and documented step-by-step integrations. The strategy prioritized utility and frictionless usage. The content roadmap included short technical how-tos, a reference site, and frequent GitHub READMEs with clear examples.</p>

  <h3>Tactics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the README as a canonical resource, host a full tutorial on the blog and link back to the GitHub repo.</li>
    <li>Write 'How we scaled X by Y' posts for product blogs and developer newsletters.</li>
    <li>Offer a hosted freemium plan with clear upgrade pathways and an early-adopter discount for newsletter subscribers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>Grew email list to 8k; converted 1% to paid in the first three months; secured three guest posts and five developer community mentions linking back to the tutorial and the friendly 'getting started' guide.</p>
</section>

<section id="interview-format">
  <h2>Interview format to solicit contributors</h2>
  <p>Use a consistent interview format to collect contributor stories. Interview formats help you publish repeatable profiles that attract backlinks and push topical authority.</p>

  <h3>Suggested questions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>What problem were you solving when you began publishing your work?</li>
    <li>What experiment gave you the clearest learning in the past 12 months?</li>
    <li>How do you measure success for your projects?</li>
    <li>What tools or templates would you recommend to other creators?</li>
    <li>Final quick tip (one sentence) for someone starting today.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>How to use interview content for links</h3>
  <p>Publish interviews as short profiles and share them with the interviewee's network; encourage contributors to link back to their profile in their own blogs and LinkedIn bios. This community-driven approach builds a natural link graph over time.</p>
</section>

<section id="data-driven-approach">
  <h2>Data-driven link opportunities</h2>
  <p>Leverage small surveys and quick polls to create original data that editors can cite. Short surveys (100–500 respondents) on a relevant topic (e.g., "What’s your top monetization channel?") provide quotable statistics and an asset for roundups.</p>

  <h3>How to run a rapid survey</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Design one-question and three-question polls for Twitter, LinkedIn, and email list.</li>
    <li>Collect responses for 7–14 days; aim for 200–500 responses.</li>
    <li>Analyze results and produce a 1-page summary PDF with charts and 3 key takeaways.</li>
    <li>Pitch the findings to relevant newsletters and journalists with a short blurb and a link to the asset.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section id="visual-assets">
  <h2>Visual assets — what to create and why</h2>
  <p>Editors prefer assets they can reuse. Provide an assets folder with PNGs and SVGs sized for social sharing and article embeds. Include captions and suggested alt text to save editors time.</p>

  <h3>Asset checklist</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>One hero image (1600x900)</li>
    <li>Two inline charts (800x400) with transparent backgrounds</li>
    <li>One downloadable template (PDF)</li>
    <li>Suggested embed code for a small interactive widget (iframe)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="long-form-playbooks">
  <h2>Long-form playbooks (extended)</h2>
  <p>Below are several extended playbooks — step-by-step actions you can follow to build momentum and earn links.</p>

  <h3>Playbook A — 12-week creator launch</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Weeks 1–2: craft a 2,000-word cornerstone article and a companion downloadable template.</li>
    <li>Weeks 3–4: publish 4 micro-posts derived from the article across social platforms and link back to the cornerstone.</li>
    <li>Weeks 5–6: outreach to 20 newsletters and 10 relevant blogs with a short pitch and asset pack.</li>
