  <h2>Case study library — deep examples</h2>
  <p>This section will grow into a catalog of full-length case studies documenting experiments and outcomes. Each study should include hypothesis, experiment design, metric tracking, outcomes, and a replication checklist.</p>

  <h3>Case framework</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Problem statement: clear, concise problem the creator aimed to solve.</li>
    <li>Hypothesis and KPI: what they expected and how success was measured.</li>
    <li>Execution steps: timelines, tools, and collaborators.</li>
    <li>Results: metrics and real outcomes.</li>
    <li>Lessons and next steps.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Example summary — productized design</h3>
  <p>Summary of a hypothetical productized design effort: created 12 templates, ran small ads to a landing page, captured 1,500 leads, converted at 2%, and iterated based on feedback. This high-level result maps to the tactical steps we recommend above.</p>
