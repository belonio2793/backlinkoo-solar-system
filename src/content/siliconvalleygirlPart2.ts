  <h2>Production workflow — from idea to multi-format asset</h2>
  <p>Your production workflow should make the most of each major piece of content. Think of a long-form video as the source of truth. From it you can generate text, clips, quotes, and downloadable assets.</p>

  <h3>Step-by-step workflow</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Research & brief: collect audience questions and competitive gaps; write a short brief with 3 learning outcomes.</li>
    <li>Record long-form: capture the full lesson or walkthrough with timestamps and chapters.</li>
    <li>Transcribe & edit: produce a cleaned transcript for the blog post and SEO optimization.</li>
    <li>Clip & iterate: extract 6–8 shareable short clips and produce optimized thumbnails/captions for distribution.</li>
    <li>Package assets: produce a PDF checklist, a template, and a small demo file that visitors can download as a lead magnet.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Quality vs speed</h3>
  <p>Find a tradeoff that matches your bandwidth. For creators who publish frequently, invest more in a great source asset and minimal time on derivative pieces; for creators who value depth, spend more time polishing both the video and the corresponding written guide.</p>
</section>

<section id="distribution">
  <h2>Distribution strategies</h2>
  <p>Content without distribution is wasted. Build a repeatable distribution playbook for each major release that includes organic social, paid amplification (selectively), newsletter outreach, and guest placements.</p>

  <h3>Organic social plan</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Publish: post the long-form asset on primary channel (e.g., YouTube).</li>
    <li>Short clips: post daily on short-form platforms for the first week.</li>
    <li>LinkedIn/Medium summary: post a repurposed narrative for professional audiences.</li>
    <li>Twitter/X threads: create 3–5 threads around key takeaways with links to the guide.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="measurement-and-iteration">
  <h2>Measurement and iteration</h2>
  <p>Measure everything: traffic, clicks, time on page, conversion rates, and backlinks. Use these signals to iterate the headline, the meta description, and the distribution tactics.</p>

  <h3>Experiment cadence</h3>
  <p>Run small experiments weekly (headline variants, thumbnail variants, clip length). Track results in a simple sheet and double down on winners.</p>
