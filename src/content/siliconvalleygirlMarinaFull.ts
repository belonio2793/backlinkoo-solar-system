<section id="core-strategies">
  <h2>Core strategies observed and how to apply them</h2>
  <h3>1) Cross-platform consistency</h3>
  <p>Maintain a clear content style and repurpose it across platforms: long-form video, short clips, and written support articles. Repurposing multiplies reach while preserving a single source of truth for deeper content.</p>
  <h3>2) Education-first approach</h3>
  <p>Create content that teaches a skill or workflow. Educational content attracts search traffic (long-tail queries) and builds trust with an audience that converts to customers or students.</p>
  <h3>3) Language accessibility</h3>
  <p>Publishing in multiple languages or providing subtitles significantly increases potential audience size and opens regional distribution channels.</p>
