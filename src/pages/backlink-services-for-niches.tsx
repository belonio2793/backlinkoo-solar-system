    <p><strong>4. Targeting Irrelevant Sites:</strong> Links from completely unrelated sites provide minimal SEO benefit and can appear manipulative. Always prioritize relevance.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Skipping Content Quality:</strong> The best link building strategy fails if your content doesn't deserve to be linked. Invest heavily in creating genuinely valuable resources.</p>
