  { question: 'Is Barry Schwartz a journalist or an SEO?', answer: 'Primarily a reporter/editor and publisher; he covers the SEO/SEM industry and also leads a software company.' },
  { question: 'How does his coverage help teams?', answer: 'It surfaces early signals, official statements, and community evidence so teams can respond responsibly and avoid over‑reactions.' },
  { question: 'What is a good approach during an update?', answer: 'Monitor, document, test small, and communicate. Defer broad changes until patterns stabilize.' },
  { question: 'Where to read his work?', answer: 'Start with Search Engine Roundtable and follow links to official sources and community discussions.' },
  { question: 'How should teams use breaking SEO news?', answer: 'Validate internally, add analytics annotations, and align changes to user value rather than rumors.' },
  { question: 'What are signs of credible coverage?', answer: 'Clear sourcing, reproducible examples, transparent caveats, and timely updates when facts evolve.' },
  { question: 'Do rankings always drop during core updates?', answer: 'No. Effects vary by site, query class, and market. Avoid universal claims based on single examples.' },
  { question: 'What if official confirmation never comes?', answer: 'Operate under uncertainty with documented hypotheses and limited‑risk tests; many changes remain unconfirmed.' },
  { question: 'Should we rewrite all content after an update?', answer: 'No. Prioritize high‑impact templates and decayed evergreen assets; measure before and after.' },
  { question: 'Are link schemes ever worth it?', answer: 'No. They jeopardize trust and risk enforcement. Earn links with useful reporting, research, and explainers.' },
  { question: 'How do we brief executives?', answer: 'Use one‑page summaries: what changed, impact, what we are doing, when to expect the next update.' },
  { question: 'What metrics matter most?', answer: 'Visibility by template, engagement quality, and citation growth—not just a single rank score.' },
  { question: 'How can small teams keep up?', answer: 'Automate monitoring, subscribe to reputable briefings, and adopt lightweight checklists.' },
  { question: 'What role do interviews play?', answer: 'They clarify mechanisms and timelines. Attribute clearly and welcome counter‑examples.' },
  { question: 'How do we handle conflicting stakeholder requests?', answer: 'Rely on pre‑agreed playbooks, freeze windows, and evidence thresholds before acting.' },

  { question: 'What about AI‑assisted search?', answer: 'Treat as another surface. Publish canonical, accurate explainers that summaries can draw from.' },
  { question: 'How can vendors pitch responsibly?', answer: 'Offer data, reproducible examples, and honest limitations. Avoid fear‑based marketing.' },
  { question: 'What is the value of glossaries?', answer: 'Shared language reduces confusion and improves team alignment during fast‑moving stories.' },
  { question: 'Why publish corrections?', answer: 'Corrections demonstrate integrity and improve long‑term trust with readers and sources.' },
  { question: 'How should we handle conflicting reports?', answer: 'Present multiple perspectives, label uncertainty, and update when clarity emerges.' },
  { question: 'What cadence should internal notes follow?', answer: 'Daily during high volatility, weekly otherwise—opt for brevity and clarity.' },
  { question: 'Should we pause link building during updates?', answer: 'Do not pursue manipulative tactics. Continue earning citations through useful, truthful content.' },
  { question: 'Do we need separate mobile playbooks?', answer: 'Yes. Validate UX, snippet behavior, and performance on real devices.' },
  { question: 'How do we minimize legal risk?', answer: 'Verify, seek comment, cite sources, and separate facts from opinion clearly.' },
  { question: 'How do newsletters fit in?', answer: 'They create habit and reduce noise—ideal for cross‑functional alignment without meetings.' },
  { question: 'What belongs in a status update?', answer: 'What changed, impact, actions, risks, and next review time—one page, no fluff.' },
  { question: 'When should we disavow?', answer: 'Rarely and only when clear evidence of harmful, manipulative links exists. Focus on earning, not pruning.' },
  { question: 'How do we use sensors responsibly?', answer: 'As hints, not verdicts. Corroborate with your own data and community reports.' },
  { question: 'What makes a good interview question?', answer: 'Specific, mechanism‑oriented, and answerable; avoid fishing for speculation.' },
