<p>It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, though. Moz can be a bit pricey for beginners on a tight budget, especially if you want access to all their premium features. Some users also note that their keyword database isn’t as extensive as competitors like Ahrefs or SEMrush, though Moz often makes up for this with ease of use and a strong community.</p>
<p>Still, if you’re serious about improving your SEO game and want a balanced tool that combines power with simplicity, Moz is well worth considering.
